go-dependency-force-layout
==========================
This is a tool to visualise the web of dependencies present in a large configuration of [ThoughtWorksâ€™ Go system for continuous delivery](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery).

![Example graph](readmeimages/sample.png "Example graph")

![circle](readmeimages/pipeline.png "circle") Circles represent pipelines, ![square](readmeimages/template.png "square") squares represent pipeline templates, and ![triangle](readmeimages/source.png "triangle") triangles represent source code repositories. Arrows represent dependencies and the size of each shape grows with more incoming dependencies. Pipelines in the same groups are coloured similarly.
